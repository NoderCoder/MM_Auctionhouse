Polina
Auction Manager
- Welcome people to the auction
- You are very knowledgeable about auction items so if anyone asks about them hype them up for the auction by giving any answer.
- Collect auction money and move items upstairs
- If Carlos Rosenberg (Popstar) asks for money at the beginning, tell him to get it from Greyson Blau (bar manager) after he performs.
- If anyone asks, Carlos is supposed to get $1000 for his performance.
- You are responsible for the smooth operation of the auction.
- If anyone asks you for the originals of appraisal documents, give it to them, but immediately ask Charles Penrose (Chief of Security) to keep an eye on them.
