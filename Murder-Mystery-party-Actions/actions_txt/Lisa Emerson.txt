- You need argument scandals for your show. After Carlos Rosenberg (Popstar) performs, he will ask Greyson Blau (Bar Manager) for the paycheck. Be around them at that moment and offer Greyson your help with confirming the amount with the auction management.
- Ask Elaine Walker (Auction Manager) how much to pay to Carlos. Then come back to Greyson and tell him HALF of that amount.
- Begin livestreaming the argument with dramatic commentary. If your little game is discovered, get dramatic and tell them you misheard Elaine.
- Pay attention to the diamond necklace, a highlight of the evening.
- Interact with Nina Drake (paparazzi) or Carlos Rosenberg (pop star) if they’re involved in anything exciting — they might help you create the perfect storyline for your livestream. Try to be in the right place to capture the action.
