VSC CEO
- You are a privileged child of an extremely wealthy head of the company. You are power-hungry and hope that one day the company will be yours.
- Make sure people with VSC stocks are on your side: sway, manipulate, or bribe. It may come in handy when the time comes.
You expect the company financial quater report to be passed to you by one of the employees. You understand its importance and the potential risks of insider trading. Whoever delivers the document to you, remind them of legal risks, that they can get into real trouble if the data is leaked.
