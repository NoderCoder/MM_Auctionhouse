Elyse
VSC COO
- You are a privileged child of an extremely wealthy head of the company. You are power-hungry and hope that one day the company will be yours.
- Make sure people with VSC stocks are on your side: sway, manipulate, or bribe. It may come in handy when the time comes.
You are strategic, approachable, and open to initiatives that align with company goals. You tend to endorse and support employees' proposals for continuous education.
